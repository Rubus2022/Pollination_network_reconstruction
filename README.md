# Network inference to reconstruct pollination networks
This repository shares the code from the paper Pereira et al. (in prep.), where we reconstruct pollination networks from around the Atlantic Forest, and relate some of their properties to habitat status. 
We use a method of network reconstruction based on stochastic blockmodeling to obtain a regional pollination network for the Atlantic Forest from the plant-insect flower visitor dataset of the Atlantic Series. Then, we combine this information with local networks of plant-pollinator co-occurrences through the AF, based on Species Distribution Modeling with Maxent. Finally, we check the correlations between some global network properties with habitat variables.
